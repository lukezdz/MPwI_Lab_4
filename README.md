# MPwI_Lab_4

Application created for 'Metody Probabilistyczne w Informatyce' course at Gdansk University of Technology.  
Author: ≈Åukasz Zdziarski

## Note
The probability table can be fully customized including its size, while launching the application or later from the menu. Option 3 in menu generates 100000 values and presents them in a form of matrix (this is the solution to the lab task). There is also one more option of log presentation (called Raw), which looks like this:
```
Coord{x: x1, y: y1}: amount1  
Coord{x: x2, y: y2}: amount2 ...
```
Setting preferred log presentation mode does not affect presentation in option 3
